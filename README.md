This is a system used to measure the force exerted on the tool which is used in Lathe
The force exerted on the tool tip is initially converted in propotion to the voltage with the help of strain gauges and voltage dividers.
Then the signel is amplified with the help of HX711 and the values are sampled by the 10 bit ADC of Arduino then it is transmitted to the PC and saved in to an Excel sheet
